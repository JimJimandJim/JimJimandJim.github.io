		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I'm taking this class as my elective in the UX/UI certificate program at BCIT. It's also helpful to my work as a technical writer, where I don't quite know enough about web development.</p>
		<p>I'm hoping to supplement/solidify my current knowledge of web development.</p>
		<h2>Something cool</h2>
		<p>I learned from the readings that semantic elements (for example, headings) are more about signifying data and doesn't really take on the role of design. As a tech writer, I think about visual layouts on pages a lot, which is more the job of CSS than HTML. This makes sense as an H1 looks <strong>large and in charge</strong> but can actually be designed to look any way you want with CSS, while still retaining the semantic value of an H1.</p>
		<p>So much more to learn.</p>
