        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Pink Floyd formed in London around 1963. Many of the forming members were studying in university. They have a storied and detailed history, so it's better served to just write the highlights:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>1967:</strong> Pink Floyd signs with EMI and release <em>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>1967:</strong> David Gilmour joins the band to replace Syd Barrett, who was having a mental health crisis induced by drugs and psychosis.</li>
            <li><strong>1967 - 1972:</strong> They release a couple other albums.</li>
            <li><strong>1973:</strong> The band team's up with Alan Parsons (also the creator of a secret space project co-opted by Dr. Evil) and release <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>1975 and 1977:</strong> They release <em>Animals</em> (1977) and <em>Wish You Were Here</em> (1975) and Syd Barrett <a target="_blank" href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/syd-barrett-wish-you-were-here-sessions/">eerily visits the studio</a> while they record.</li>
            <li><strong>1979:</strong> Roger Waters <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dw.com/en/roger-waters-the-wall-the-real-story-behind-pink-floyds-legendary-album/a-18747933">generally starts to hate people</a> and writes <em>The Wall</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Not long after, Roger Waters decided that, being people, he also <a target="_blank" href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/pink-floyd-david-gilmour-roger-waters-feud-reason/">hated his band members too</a>. They have since gone separate and interesting directions.</p>
